       Welcome to Club Town! Club Town gives you a list of clubs that are free to join. If there is one group you want to join, but know nothing of it, don't worry. Discriptions are at the bottom of the name. It will also say the dates, and if the club is W.I.P (work in progress). If you want to join a club, and the club is SOMETHING you don't know, for example, some might not know Harry Potter, we do fun lessons about that club and you can learn from those. Have fun! Also, I'm up to any suggestions on clubs! You can E-Mail me. My G-Mail is ottergirl24@gmail.com. (without the period). Currently ALL clubs are W.I.P, so nobody can join them yet :( sorry.
