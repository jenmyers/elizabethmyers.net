# Elizabeth's Website

I'm teaching my seven-year-old daughter Elizabeth how to write HTML. This is the repository for her website files. I help with details and ops, but she types all the HTML and CSS in herself and writes her own content. She also types the git commands to push it to the web. We'll be adding more to her website as she learns.

__What we're going to learn next__

- How to use different fonts
- How to use padding
- How to make links different colors
