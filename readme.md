# Elizabeth's Website

I'm teaching my seven-year-old daughter Elizabeth how to write HTML. This is the repository for her website files. I help with details and ops, but she types all the HTML in herself and writes her own content. We'll be adding more to her website as she learns.

__What we're going to learn next__

- How to use different fonts
